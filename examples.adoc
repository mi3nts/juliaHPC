# Julia Examples on HPC Systems

Most of UT Dallas HPC Systems use https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html[SLURM] work load manager. Following are a set of examples on scheduling julia jobs on HPC Systems. The example scripts can be found at the examples folder. 


## Running Serial Jobs 

### Example 1 

Example 1 is a hello world example for Julia (examples/ex_01_hello_world.jl). 

`println("Hello World !")`

The following is a simple slurms script (examples/ex_01_slurm.sh) to run the hello world example. 

```
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH -J helloWorld                          # Job name
#SBATCH -o logs/helloWorld.%j.out              # Name of stdout output file (%j expands to jobId)
#SBATCH -e logs/helloWorld.%j.err              # Error File Name 
#SBATCH --mail-type=begin                      # Mail events (NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, ALL)
#SBATCH --mail-user=lhw150030@utdallas.edu     # Where to send mail	
#SBATCH -N 1                                   # Total number of nodes requested
#SBATCH -n 1                                   # Total number of mpi tasks requested
#SBATCH -t 00:01:00                            # Run time (hh:mm:ss) - 1 minute

echo Running on host: `hostname`
julia ex_01_hello_world.jl
```

You can run the Julia script by simply submitting the job to the cluster via the following command. 

`sbatch examples/ex_01_slurm.sh`. 


Following are the steps you would need to follow to run this example on EUROPA. Make sure t
```
ssh [EUROPA_ID]@europa.trecis.cloud
cd scratch/[EUROPA_ID]
git clone git@github.com:mi3nts/juliaHPC.git
cd /scratch/lhw150030/juliaHPC/examples
# At this point edit the change the email address on the ex_01_slurm.sh to your own one
sbatch ex_01_slurm.sh
```
