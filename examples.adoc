# Julia Examples on HPC Systems

Most of UT Dallas HPC Systems use https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html[SLURM] work load manager. Following are a set of examples on scheduling julia jobs on HPC Systems. The example scripts can be found at the examples folder. 


## Running Serial Jobs 

### Example 1 

Example 1 is a hello world example for Julia (examples/ex_01_hello_world.jl). 

`println("Hello World !")`

The following is a simple slurms script (examples/ex_01_slurm.sh) to run the hello world example. 

```
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH -J helloWorld                          # Job name
#SBATCH -o logs/helloWorld.%j.out              # Name of stdout output file (%j expands to jobId)
#SBATCH -e logs/helloWorld.%j.err              # Error File Name 
#SBATCH --mail-type=begin                      # Mail events (NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, ALL)
#SBATCH --mail-user=lhw150030@utdallas.edu     # Where to send mail	
#SBATCH -N 1                                   # Total number of nodes requested
#SBATCH -n 1                                   # Total number of mpi tasks requested
#SBATCH -t 00:01:00                            # Run time (hh:mm:ss) - 1 minute

echo Running on host: `hostname`
julia ex_01_hello_world.jl
```

You can run the Julia script by simply submitting the job to the cluster via the following command. 

`sbatch examples/ex_01_slurm.sh`. 


Following are the steps you would need to follow to run this example on EUROPA. 
```
ssh [EUROPA_ID]@europa.trecis.cloud
cd scratch/[EUROPA_ID]
git clone git@github.com:mi3nts/juliaHPC.git
cd /scratch/[EUROPA_ID]/juliaHPC/examples
# At this point edit the change the email address on the ex_01_slurm.sh to your own one
sbatch ex_01_slurm.sh
```

### Example 2 
Following is a simple program (examples/ex_02_factorial_function_simple.jl) which computes the factorial of 7.

```
function factorialFunction(num::Int64)
     if num < 0
        print("Factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
     elseif num == 0
        return 1
     else
        return num*factorialFunction(num - 1)    
     end
end

answer = factorialFunction(7)
println("The 7th Factorial Number is:" * string(answer))
```
The SLURM submission script is designed to run this script (examples/ex_02_slurm.sh) is given below. 

```
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH -J factorialFunctionSimple                          # Job name
#SBATCH -o logs/factorialFunctionSimple.%j.out              # Name of stdout output file (%j expands to jobId)
#SBATCH -e logs/factorialFunctionSimple.%j.err              # Error File Name 
#SBATCH --mail-type=begin                      # Mail events (NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, ALL)
#SBATCH --mail-user=lhw150030@utdallas.edu     # Where to send mail	
#SBATCH -N 1                                   # Total number of nodes requested
#SBATCH -n 1                                   # Total number of mpi tasks requested
#SBATCH -t 00:01:00                            # Run time (hh:mm:ss) - 1 minute

echo Running on host: `hostname`
julia ex_02_factorial_function_simple.jl
```
The job can be easily submittedvia the shell with 

`sbatch examples/ex_02_slurm.sh`

## Running Parrelel Jobs via job arrays

Running a script with only one hyperparameter changed can be useful when we need to run multiple jobs with little or no changes. SLURM offers an ideal way to accomplish such tasks by using job arrays. This allows the running of consuming jobs in parallel, thereby saving a considerable amount of time. Job arrays are designed to run the same script under different versions. This is illustrated in Example 3.


### Example 3 
In this example, we use SLURM to calculate multiple factorials using job arrays similar to example 2. In the following example script (examples/ex_03_factorial_function_via_job_arrays.jl), an array index is taken as an argument from its SLURM counterpart script (examples/ex_03_slurm.sh) to calculate factorials for 7, 8, 9 and 10.

#### ex_03_factorial_function_via_job_arrays.jl

```
arrayID        = Base.parse(Int, ENV["SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID"])
arrayValues    = [7; 8; 9; 10]
factorialIndex = arrayValues[arrayID]

function factorialFunction(num::Int64)
     if num < 0
        print("Factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
     elseif num == 0
        return 1
     else
        return num*factorialFunction(num - 1)    
     end
end

println("The $(factorialIndex)th Factorial Number is: $(factorialFunction(factorialIndex)).")
```

#### examples/ex_03_slurm.sh
```
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH -J factorialFunctionViaJobArrays                         # Job name
#SBATCH -o logs/factorialFunctionViaJobArrays.%j.out              # Name of stdout output file (%j expands to jobId)
#SBATCH -e logs/factorialFunctionViaJobArrays.%j.err              # Error File Name 
#SBATCH --mail-type=begin                      # Mail events (NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, ALL)
#SBATCH --mail-user=lhw150030@utdallas.edu     # Where to send mail	
#SBATCH -N 1                                   # Total number of nodes requested
#SBATCH -n 1                                   # Total number of mpi tasks requested
#SBATCH -t 00:01:00                            # Run time (hh:mm:ss) - 1 minute
#SBATCH --array=1-4


echo Running on host: `hostname`
echo Running scripts for slurm array index: "$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID"
